# 🎵 Sonare

## Overview

Sonare is a collaborative music app that enables spontaneous, remote co-creation between musicians. Instead of passively listening to music, users can post short audio clips and invite others to build on them with their own layers—creating a living chain of musical creativity. 

Inspired by the TikTok/Reels format, Sonare brings musicians together through seamless remixing and contribution, making collaboration easy, fun, and accessible from anywhere.
